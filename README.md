- Such kind of analysis can significantly enhance the ability of relevant authorities to effectively monitor and track the flow of funds between Bitcoin accounts
    - **For example** : From observation, there are a few accounts from which the money is completely sent once received and hence can be categorized as shell accounts     
      (Note : This cannot be confirmed for sure, but such accounts can be tagged by the authorities and monitored further for leads).
